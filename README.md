# hecht

hecht will become an audiobook player for the commandline.
It is under active development, so usage is a bit strange for now.

The goal is to list audiobooks and keep track on what you listened to.

## Usage
Put your audiobooks inside a folder named `lib` next to your hecht binary.
The name of each folder inside `lib` will be the audiobook name. Inside it you need to put your audio files.

```
lib
├── book1
│   ├── ch1.mp3
│   └── ch2.mp3
└── book2
    ├── alpha.mp3
    └── beta.mp3
```
